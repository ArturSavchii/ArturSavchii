### âœ¨About me:

ðŸ‘‹Welcome! I am Artur Savchii, [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) student, blending my passions for Mathematics and Data Science.

**On my GitHub repository you can find:**

1. *Kaggle-time-series* - Kaggle data science practice competition on time series I finished in the top 10%.
2. *ML-practice* - my machine learning practice notebooks.
   *  a generative NLP model that predicts the next words in a text sequence based on Shakespeare's sonnets data;
   *  a CNN model that classifies images of American sign language's letters;
   *  an NLP model that determines the text's sentiment;
3. *Math Homeworks* - the problem sets I solved in the Real Analysis and Differential Equations classes.
